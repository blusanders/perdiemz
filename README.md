Per Diemz is a simple to for a music tour manager to quickly calcuate bill denominations for a tour run. How many $20 bills do you need for a 50 person crew when you go out for 13 days? How bout 10s? What if no one wants a $50 bill? What if they only want one 50? Silly calculations that you don't need to make every time you hit the road.

I came from the country touring world where we were in and out often, which meant too many hours doing math that could be better spent doing other things.

My intention originally was to create my tour/crew in Mastertour, the software I used for years, and expland from there but their API and crew management didn't quick do what I needed it to do, so for the purposes of this app, I used local data.
